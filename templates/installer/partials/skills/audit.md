# Knowledge-base audit

Three checks, each a single MCP call:

1. `knowledge.list_inbox(limit=20)` — notes the worker captured but
   the curator hasn't classified yet. A persistent backlog signals
   that Ollama is wedged or the classifier is rejecting too much.
2. `knowledge.list_tags(limit=100)` — scan for near-duplicate
   spellings (`kotlin` / `Kotlin` / `kt`, `ci` / `CI` / `ci-cd`).
   Propose `knowledge.rename_tag(from, to)` for the cleanups, but
   don't run them — those are admin-only mutations.
3. `knowledge.list_topics(limit=100)` — flag topics with note_count
   of 1 or 2 (thin) and pairs of slugs that look like duplicates.
   Propose `knowledge.merge_topics(from_slug, into_slug)` for the
   candidates.

Report findings in three short sections. Don't mutate anything —
the operator runs the proposed merges / renames manually after
review.
